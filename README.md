# Homelab

Welcome to my personal homelab project. This repo contains my documentation, hardware information, configs etc. 
The main purpose of this project is to learn about the world of self-hosting and to replace cloud-services.

## Hardware Setup
I am using an old pc for my server. It has a AMD Ryzen 3 2200G CPU with an integrated GPU. Its running Debian 12.

## Services Hosted
- Nextcloud
- Immich
- Adguard
- Portainer
- Nginx Proxy Manager

## Future Goals
- Setup kubernetes instead of docker compose
- Setup nginx reverse proxy manager
- Setup tailscale
- Setup remote access for nextcloud
